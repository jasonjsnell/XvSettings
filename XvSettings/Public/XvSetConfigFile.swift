/*
 
 This file is used when the app first installs or a user restores the factory settings
 It is an exact duplicate of the variables in the XcDataModel file in this particular app
 If the data model is updated, this file needs to be too
 
 On app first-time installation, this file installs both app and track level vars into Core Data
 Then on app launch, core data values will be loaded into the sequencer system, MIDI, etc...
